# Foil [![Actions Status](https://github.com/jessesquires/Foil/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jessesquires/Foil/actions)

*A lightweight [property wrapper](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Attributes.html#ID348) for UserDefaults done right*

## About

Read the post: [A better approach to writing a UserDefaults Property Wrapper](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/2021/03/26/a-better-approach-to-writing-a-userdefaults-property-wrapper/)

#### Why the name?

Foil, as in let me quickly and easily **wrap** and **store** this leftover food in some **foil** so I can eat it later. 🌯 😉

> [Foil](https://www.wordnik.com/words/aluminum%20foil):<br>
> **noun**<br>
> *North America*<br>
> A very thin, pliable, easily torn sheet of aluminum used for cooking, packaging, cosmetics, and insulation.

## Usage

You can use `@WrappedDefault` for non-optional values and `@WrappedDefaultOptional` for optional ones.
You may wish to store all your user defaults in one place, however, that is not necessary. **Any** property on **any type** can use this wrapper.

```swift
final class AppSettings {
    static let shared = AppSettings()

    @WrappedDefault(keyName: "flagEnabled", defaultValue: true)
    var flagEnabled: Bool

    @WrappedDefault(keyName: "totalCount", defaultValue: 0)
    var totalCount: Int

    @WrappedDefaultOptional(keyName: "timestamp")
    var timestamp: Date?
}

// Usage

func userDidToggleSetting(_ sender: UISwitch) {
    AppSettings.shared.flagEnabled = sender.isOn
}
```

There is also an included example app project.

### Using `enum` keys

If you prefer using an `enum` for the keys, writing an extension specific to your app is easy. However, this is not required. In fact, unless you have a specific reason to reference the keys, this is completely unneccessary.

```swift
enum AppSettingsKey: String, CaseIterable {
    case flagEnabled
    case totalCount
    case timestamp
}

extension WrappedDefault {
    init(key: AppSettingsKey, defaultValue: T) {
        self.init(keyName: key.rawValue, defaultValue: defaultValue)
    }
}

extension WrappedDefaultOptional {
    init(key: AppSettingsKey) {
        self.init(keyName: key.rawValue)
    }
}
```

### Observing with Combine

To support KVO monitoring via Combine, use the `NSObject.KeyValueObservingPublisher` helpers [provided by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/performing-key-value-observing-with-combine). This requires your object to inherit from `NSObject` and adding `@objc dynamic` to the properties you would like to observe:

```swift
final class AppSettings: NSObject {
    static let shared = AppSettings()

    @WrappedDefaultOptional(keyName: "nickname")
    @objc dynamic var nickname: String?
}

// Usage

AppSettings.shared
    .publisher(for: \.nickname, options: [.new])
    .sink { print($0) }
    .store(in: &cancellable)

AppSettings.shared.nickname = "abc123"
// prints "abc123" from `.sink`
```

### Supported types

The following types are supported by default for use with `@WrappedDefault`.

Adding support for custom types is possible by conforming to `UserDefaultsSerializable`. However, **this is highly discouraged**. `UserDefaults` is not intended for storing complex data structures and object graphs. You should probably be using a proper database (or serializing to disk via `Codable`) instead.

- `Bool`
- `Int`
- `Float`
- `Double`
- `String`
- `URL`
- `Date`
- `Data`
- `Array`
- `Set`
- `Dictionary`
- `RawRepresentable` types
