## About

Read the post: [A better approach to writing a UserDefaults Property Wrapper](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/2021/03/26/a-better-approach-to-writing-a-userdefaults-property-wrapper/)

#### Why the name?

Foil, as in "let me quickly and easily **wrap** and **store** this leftover food in some **foil** so I can eat it later." 🌯 😉

> [Foil](https://www.wordnik.com/words/aluminum%20foil):<br>
> **noun**<br>
> *North America*<br>
> A very thin, pliable, easily torn sheet of aluminum used for cooking, packaging, cosmetics, and insulation.

## Usage

You can use `@WrappedDefault` for non-optional values and `@WrappedDefaultOptional` for optional ones.
You may wish to store all your user defaults in one place, however, that is not necessary. **Any** property on **any type** can use this wrapper.

```swift
final class AppSettings {
    static let shared = AppSettings()

    @WrappedDefault(key: "flagEnabled")
    var flagEnabled = true

    @WrappedDefault(key: "totalCount")
    var totalCount = 0

    @WrappedDefaultOptional(key: "timestamp")
    var timestamp: Date?
}

// Usage

func userDidToggleSetting(_ sender: UISwitch) {
    AppSettings.shared.flagEnabled = sender.isOn
}
```

There is also an included example app project.

### Using `enum` keys

If you prefer using an `enum` for the keys, writing an extension specific to your app is easy. However, this is not required. In fact, unless you have a specific reason to reference the keys, this is completely unnecessary.

```swift
enum AppSettingsKey: String, CaseIterable {
    case flagEnabled
    case totalCount
    case timestamp
}

extension WrappedDefault {
    init(wrappedValue: T, _ key: AppSettingsKey) {
        self.init(wrappedValue: wrappedValue, key: key.rawValue)
    }
}

extension WrappedDefaultOptional {
    init(_ key: AppSettingsKey) {
        self.init(key: key.rawValue)
    }
}
```

### Observing changes

There are [many ways to observe property changes](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/2021/08/08/different-ways-to-observe-properties-in-swift/). The most common are by using Key-Value Observing or a Combine Publisher. KVO observing requires the object with the property to inherit from `NSObject` and the property must be declared as `@objc dynamic`.

```swift
final class AppSettings: NSObject {
    static let shared = AppSettings()

    @WrappedDefaultOptional(key: "userId")
    @objc dynamic var userId: String?

    @WrappedDefaultOptional(key: "average")
    var average: Double?
}
```

#### Using KVO

```swift
let observer = AppSettings.shared.observe(\.userId, options: [.new]) { settings, change in
    print(change)
}
```

#### Using Combine

**Note:** that `average` does not need the `@objc dynamic` annotation, `.receiveValue` will fire immediately with the current value of `average` and on every change after.

```swift
AppSettings.shared.$average
    .sink {
        print($0)
    }
    .store(in: &cancellable)
```

#### Combine Alternative with KVO

**Note:** in this case, `userId` needs the `@objc dynamic` annotation and `AppSettings` needs to inherit from `NSObject`. Then `receiveValue` will fire only on changes to wrapped object's value. It will not publish the initial value as in the example above.

```swift
AppSettings.shared
    .publisher(for: \.userId, options: [.new])
    .sink {
        print($0)
    }
    .store(in: &cancellable)
```

### Supported types

The following types are supported by default for use with `@WrappedDefault`.

Adding support for custom types is possible by conforming to `UserDefaultsSerializable`. However, **this is highly discouraged**. `UserDefaults` is not intended for storing complex data structures and object graphs. You should probably be using a proper database (or serializing to disk via `Codable`) instead.

- `Bool`
- `Int`
- `UInt`
- `Float`
- `Double`
- `String`
- `URL`
- `Date`
- `Data`
- `Array`
- `Set`
- `Dictionary`
- `RawRepresentable` types
